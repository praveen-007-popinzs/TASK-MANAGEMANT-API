Hi,

We would like to invite you to complete a coding test as part of the interview process. Please find the requirements for the application below:

Assignment: Task Management API
Objective:
Build a simple Task Management API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

Requirements:

Set Up the Project:
    * Initialize a new Node.js project using npm.
    * Use Express.js to create a server.
    * Set up a connection to MongoDB for data storage.

Task Model:
* Define a Task model with properties like title, description, dueDate, and completed.

User Authentication
* Implement features for user registration, login, logout, and password reset.

Authentication:
    * Implement a simple authentication mechanism (e.g., using JWT tokens).
    * Secure endpoints so that only authenticated users can perform CRUD operations.

CRUD Operations:
* Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.

User Roles:
* Include role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain routes or resources based on user roles. (e.g., Admin role only can create, update, delete tasks, member role can only read tasks)

Validation:
    * Implement validation for task creation and updates.
    * Ensure that required fields are provided, and due dates are in the future.

Middleware:
    * Create middleware to log incoming requests.
    * Implement error handling middleware for better error responses.

Pagination:
    * Implement pagination for fetching tasks to handle large datasets.
    * Allow users to specify the page number and limit in the request.

Sorting and Filtering:
    * Allow users to sort tasks based on different criteria (e.g., due date, completion status).
    * Implement filtering to fetch tasks that match specific criteria.

Submission:
Please complete the assignment within 5 days of receiving this email and send us the source code and any instructions needed to run the application.

Please commit the source code to your Github repository, as it will make it easier for us to validate your work. Kindly acknowledge the email back.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
We look forward to receiving your application and wish you the best of luck!
